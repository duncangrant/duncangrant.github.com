Use cases:
Start to drag bucketable causes bucket container to appear and page to "grey"
Drag over bucket highlights bucket or causes popup menu etc
Drop on bucket causes two events? (event on bucket with bucketable and vice versa)
More than one bucket container?
Some buckets not always relevant.
If not dropped on bucket return to base
If dropped on bucket delete

Need:
.bubketable({drop:fn(bucket)})

.bucketContainer({activate:fn, deactivate:fn})

.bucket({ over: fn, out: fn, drop: fn(bucketable), activate:fn, deactivate:fn})
